            <h3>Portland, the city of roses üåπ</h3>
            <p>
              Portland is perhaps best known for being a sustainability-minded,
              bike-friendly city with easy access to nature ; plentiful coffee,
              art, craft beer, delicious food and live music; and crafty people
              who celebrate individuality and creativity (which, yes, some
              people call ‚Äúweird").

            <p>
              The "City of Roses" üåπ is the official nickname of Portland. Did
              you even know it was possible to have an official nickname? Now
              you know. The Portland Rose Society was founded in 1889 by
              Georgiana Burton Pittock (wife of Oregonian publisher Henry
              Pittock), after she invited her friends over to exhibit their
              roses in her garden. After that, the city became obsessed with
              roses, planting them so they bordered the streets. In 1905, during
              the Lewis and Clark Centennial celebration, there were 200 miles
              of rose-lined streets. It was then that Portland was dubbed the
              "City of Roses."
